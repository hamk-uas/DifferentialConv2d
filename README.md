# DiffConv2d (HAMK fork)

This is forked from the [original code repository](https://github.com/stfc-sciml/DifferentialConv2d) for the following paper: 
```
K. Leng and J. Thiyagalingam, Padding-free Convolution based on
Preservation of Differential Characteristics of Kernels.
```

This repository is intended for testing and extending that work and for testing other convolutional layer border handling methods using the testing framework developed in the original work.
