# DiffConv2d (HAMK fork)

This is forked from the original code repository for the following paper: 
```
K. Leng and J. Thiyagalingam, Padding-free Convolution based on
Preservation of Differential Characteristics of Kernels.
```

This repository is intended for extending that work and for testing other convolutional layer border handling methods using the testing framework developed in the original work.
